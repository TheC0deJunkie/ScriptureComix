# ScriptureComix 

**Interactive / Visual Bible Adventures**

This is a personal project I’m building for anyone who — like me — loves the Bible but struggles with traditional text-only reading.  
My aim: make reading, understanding and studying God’s Word easier and more engaging by presenting Scripture in *visual, contextual and interactive format*.

## 🚀 What it does

- Turns Bible chapters into comic-style panels with images + text bubbles  
- Provides AI-powered explainers and contextual notes (summaries, historical/cultural background, deeper meaning)  
- Supports multiple translations, versions, and even “lost books” / alternate canons for user choice  
- Offers a mix of free content and optional premium (paywall) features — while avoiding intrusive ads  
- Allows users to read, study, and interact — regardless of age or background

## 💡 Project status

- **Work in progress** — this is a bootstrapped, personal initiative.  
- All core features are being built and refined; many advanced features still under development.  
- Hosting, AI-model usage, and image generation are currently funded through community support and donations.
